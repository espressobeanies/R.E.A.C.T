# R.E.A.C.T
Purpose: The purpose of this script is to give Security Analysts enough "reaction time" (R.E.A.C.T) to effectively process an overflowing amount of data from multiple sources, searching for any potentially malicious indicators from any clipboard-copied source to get the information you need to help block intruders on a network as quickly as possible. It achieves this through URL obfuscation/deobfuscation,

The primary goal here is lightning-speed reaction. As a disclaimer, please test this code on your own to familiarize yourself with the shortcomings, limitations this program contains.
