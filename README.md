# R.E.A.C.T
Purpose: The purpose of this script is to give Security Analysts, dubbed "the Defenders", enough "reaction" time (thus R.E.A.C.T) to effectively process an overflowing amount of data from multiple sources, looking for potentially malicious indicators in any output list, as well as obfuscate and deobfuscate URLs for message warnings or blocking to help lockout "the bad guys" on a network.

The primary goal here is lightning speed analysis. Bad guys use scripts and code to break into the system, therefore the good guys should be doing the same to defend the system. As a disclaimer, please test this code on your own to familiarize yourself with the shortcomings, limitations this program contains.
